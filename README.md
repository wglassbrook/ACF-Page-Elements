#ACF-Page-Elements

Remember that time when I created a crap load of ACF page elements (see [ACF Pro - Custom Page Options](https://github.com/wglassbrook/ACF-PRO-Custom-Page-Options)) based on the ACF Pro Felxible Content Fields? Yeah, that was cool.  

I got kinda tired of always trying to crowbar it into my WP themes, so I decided to make it into a WP plugin.  

There's a lot of cary-over from the original code, but there's been significant updates here, including, but not limited to the fact that the Page Elements are now filtered into `the_content()` instead of adding it manually to the theme.
